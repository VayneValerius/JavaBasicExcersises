# JavaExcersises
Week1 Java Code

The excersises I have done in my first week of Java programming.

The offline excersise folder is code that I did using offline documentation only.

(Both JoshKingswell and VayneValerius are the same person i.e me, one is an official account and the other was for testing gitHub out)
